# No rats were harmed

A game about observation and cheese.

Built for Bevy Jam 3.

Welcome to "No Rats Were Harmed," the puzzle game where you play as a lab researcher tasked with identifying the positive effects and side effects of unknown medicines. To do this, you'll need to carefully observe the behavior of a test subject - a lab rat - after giving it a medicine and releasing it into a labyrinth to find cheese. Use your critical thinking skills to identify the properties of each medicine. If you label the medicines incorrectly, the lab will be threatened with a class action lawsuit by unhappy customers!

Test your problem-solving skills while keeping your conscience clear. Disclaimer: only one experiment is available at the moment.
