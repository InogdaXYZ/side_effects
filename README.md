# No rats were harmed

A game about observation and cheese.

Built for Bevy Jam 3.

Welcome to "No Rats Were Harmed," the puzzle game where you play as a lab researcher tasked with identifying the positive effects and side effects of unknown medicines. To do this, you'll need to carefully observe the behavior of a test subject - a lab rat - after giving it a medicine and releasing it into a labyrinth to find cheese. Use your critical thinking skills to identify the properties of each medicine. If you label the medicines incorrectly, the lab will be threatened with a class action lawsuit by unhappy customers!

Test your problem-solving skills while keeping your conscience clear. Disclaimer: only one experiment is available at the moment.

No rats were harmed in the making of this game.

Hints:

Lab rats donâ€™t have great vision and rely on memory and smell.
Cats are scary even when they are not real.
Not all cheese smells good.
Uninterested rats will generally just roam around.
The hungrier a rat is, the more actively it searches for food.
Not all medicines have side effects.
Some medicines are nothing but side effects.
Effects of one medicine can be compensated by another.
A lazy rat is a poor source of insight.
