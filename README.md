# No rats were harmed

A game about observation and cheese.

Built for Bevy Jam 3.

Welcome to "No Rats Were Harmed," the puzzle game where you play as a lab researcher tasked with identifying the positive effects and side effects of unknown medicines. To do this, you'll need to carefully observe the behavior of a test subject - a lab rat - after giving it a medicine and releasing it into a labyrinth to find cheese. Use your critical thinking skills to identify the properties of each medicine. If you label the medicines incorrectly, the lab will be threatened with a class action lawsuit by unhappy customers!

Test your problem-solving skills while keeping your conscience clear. Disclaimer: only one experiment is available at the moment.

No rats were harmed in the making of this game.

## Hints

- Lab rats don’t have great vision and rely on memory and smell.
- Cats are scary even when they are not real.
- Not all cheese smells good.
- Uninterested rats will generally just roam around.
- The hungrier a rat is, the more actively it searches for food.
- A lazy rat is a poor source of insight.
- Not all medicines have side effects.
- Some medicines are nothing but side effects.
- Effects of one medicine can be compensated by another.
